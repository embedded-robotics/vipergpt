class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int
        An int describing the position of the (left/lower/right/upper) border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Methods
    -------
    find_histo_patches(self)->list[ImagePatch]
        If the image is a pathology image, it returns a list of ImagePatch objects containing image crops densely populated with pathology information i.e,. cell nuclei . Otherwise, returns a list with single ImagePatch object containing the original crop.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
    llm_query(question: str, long_answer: bool)->str
        References a large language model (e.g., GPT) to produce a response to the given question. Default is short-form answers, can be made long-form responses with the long_answer flag.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int)->ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.
    overlaps_with(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int) -> bool:
        Returns True if a crop with the given coordinates overlaps with this one, else returns False
    llava_med_query(self, question: str) -> str:
        Returns the answer to a pathology question asked about the image. The questions are about basic perception, and are not meant to be used for complex reasoning
        or external knowledge.

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query.

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- Use the llm_query function to access external information and answer informational questions not concerning the image.
- The function should take image from ImagePatch class into account while answering the query
